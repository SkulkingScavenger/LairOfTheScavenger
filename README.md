# LairOfTheScavenger

"Through me you pass into the site of fluff:  
Through me you pass into rarely updated stuff:  
Through me among the people with nothing better to do.  
need of server space the founder of my fabric moved:  
To rear me was the task of loophole exploitation sublime,         
Supremest Nerdery, and primeval lack of funds. 
Before me stuff webhosted were none, save things  
Temporary, and temporarily I endure.  
Abandon all hope, ye who enter here."
