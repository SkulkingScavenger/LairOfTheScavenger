		<h1>The Zakasi</h1>

				<div>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Zakasi are a race of eyeless, nocturnal scavengers. They haunt the fringes of civilization, lurking in desolate regions where they lie in wait for passers-by. A ghoulish instinct draws them to battlefields and plague-stricken settlements or anywhere death and corpses may be found in great enough quantities to satisfy their ravenous hunger.

				<div>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zakasi are long and wiry in frame, with crouching posture and slinking gait. Their eyeless, bullet-shaped heads are dominated by vastly overlarge, toothy maws that stretch back to their bat-like ears. They have long arms and short legs of digitigrade form. They have sinuous, catlike tails terminating in scraggly tufts. A mane of stiff fur runs down their spine from the crown of the skull to the small of their backs. They have pads on both hands and paws, enabling them to move quietly even on all fours. Their fingers are long and powerful, ending with razor-like talons. Their bodies are covered in short, mangy fur of drab, greyish coloration.

					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emboldened by insatiable craving for flesh, it is not uncommon for zakasi clans to lair near human settlements, infesting catacombs, sewers, and barrows. While their relative strength is low, the zakasi hide their presence, picking off the poor and isolated, taking advantage of violent circumstances, and stealing such livestock as may plausibly be blamed on local wildlife. As their strength waxes, the zakasi grow bolder, emerging under cover of darkness to leave the settlement lifeless and desolate. Many clans prefer to cow their victims rather than simply overrun them, demanding tribute and preying only on those foolish enough to venture into their territory.

				<div>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zakasi society is cruel and anarchic, rife with treachery and intrigue. They are united only by their fear and hatred of the civilized races. Left to their own devices they form loose semi-nomadic clans, typically led by a chieftain or council of elders. They are said to revere a hideous deity of the night, to whom they offer human sacrifices on moonless nights. They are down for their caustic personalities: sarcastic, witty, and spiteful, they delight in the confusion and misfortune of others. 
				</div><br>
				<div>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite their many faults, they are often employed as mercenaries by those who know how to deal with them. While thus employed, they can be induced to adopt more orderly behavior. Indeed, if their treacherous instincts can be discouraged, they make for cunning and ruthlessly effective officers.

				<div>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being eyeless, Zakasi rely on scent, hearing, and refined sensitivity to vibrations in the ground and fluctuations in the air. They are able to mimic voices they have heard, which they often use to bait unwary travelers. Their normal voices are raspy and high-pitched, with an unnerving quality, and their cackling and keening on moonless nights have been known to inspire madness in the most extreme cases. Their language has a yipping, tittering quality due to the significance of changing pitch and common repetition of syllables. 
				</div><br>
				<div>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notoriously sly and cunning, zakasi delight in trickery and deception. They prefer to avoid direct confrontation in favor of stealth, but when pressed to combat they are savage opponents. Zakasi wield all manner of weapons and armor both looted from the dead and crafted from the bones and hides of their victims. Even unarmed, the zakasi can inflict terrible damage. Their gangly build belies their terrible strength, and as many of their victims have had their lives suddenly choked out by the iron grip of long, sinewy fingers as have had their flesh rent by their sharpened claws. However, more terrifying than their claws are their huge jaws, brimming with rows of teeth, wide enough to swallow a man whole and powerful enough crunch through bone and plate with impunity. 
				</div><br>
				<div>
					&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Zakasi usually wear only such clothing and armor as allows them to move quietly and blend in with their surroundings. Although zakasi have no difficulty deriving nourishment from osseous material, they are also fond of adorning themselves and their lairs with the bones of their victims. Zakasi are more resilient to shifts in temperature than humans, but due to rampant theft, zakasi have great need of pockets and other means of mobile storage. Belts and bandoleers are popular for this reason.
